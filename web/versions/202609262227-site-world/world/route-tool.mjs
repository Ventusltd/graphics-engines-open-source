// Route tool: a small state machine for drawing a route on the ground, in Walk or Drone view.
// It knows nothing about the DOM, trenches or cables; it only holds an ordered list of points in local
// metres [x, y, z] (east, north, up from the site origin). The page turns clicks into ground points and
// keys into calls; a layer draws state.points. Every change calls onChange(state) once.
//
// Rules:
//   addPoint   appends a point; ignored once the route is finished, or if it repeats the last point.
//   movePoint  moves an existing point (allowed before and after finishing) and selects it.
//   removeLast undoes the last point; ignored once the route is finished (clear starts again).
//   finish     closes the route; needs at least two points.
//   clear      empties the route and reopens it.
// Each method returns true if it changed the route, false if it was ignored.
